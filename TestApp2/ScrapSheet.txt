The Redlands Goblin Bison butter, provided in large quantities in a barrel. Redlands Goblins themselves do not carry large barrels of this size due to their nomadic nature, so it&#39;s likely this was acquired as part of a trade deal from a Redlands Clan filled during a period of rest. To be able to produce this much Gobbull Butter and give it away in trade means it&#39;s probably from a clan rich in Goblin Bison.
